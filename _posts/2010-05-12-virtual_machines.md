Demo Maven Alert!  [Virtual demonstration machines](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=751fa0d1-356c-4002-9c60-d539896c66ce&displaylang=en) are available for download from Microsoft!  Now all you need is Windows Server 2008 R2 with Hyper-V role enabled and BAM you are ready. 

I just love it when it feels like Christmas in the middle of summer!  Now however, I must find the time to play with them once I've completed my download! 

Enjoy!

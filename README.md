**Doing meaningful work while being more productive is possible!**  
Having a meaningful career in the technology business while helping your organization be more innovative, productive and competitive can be done. There are clear steps to help you along the path of both.      

This site is dedicated to practical ideas for utilizing modern technology and transforming your career.  Collaboration, mobility, social and business intelligence tools are only as strong as the strategy that brings them together.  The tools are not meaningful unless you have a diverse, engaged and creative workforce.  So, for me both things work together and also happen to be two of my passions.  

This site is broken into three separate topics:

- **Productivity and Collaboration blog**: Helping business people get value from Microsoft tech
- [**Implementing Agile Service Management**](.\asm\index.md): Guidance for IT and tech pros to change the way they deliver within their companies
- **[Leadership how-to's](.\leadership\index.md)**: Steps to develop a diverse workforce for everyone

The thoughts and ideas here are my own. Take what you need and leave the rest.  Tell me what is and isn't working for you via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karuana) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/karuanagatimu).  I'm always happy to hear from you.

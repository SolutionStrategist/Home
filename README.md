**​​​​​Don't settle!**  
If the technology in your life, both at home and work, is not deriving more meaning for you then it's time for change.  

This site is dedicated to practical ideas for utilizing modern technology.  Collaboration, mobility, social and business intelligence tools are only as strong as the strategy that brings them together in a beautiful experience that is meaningful to employees and management alike. 

This site is broken into three separate topics:

* Productivity and Collaboration Tech blog for business users
* Agile Service Management guidance for IT and tech pros
* [Leadership how-to's](https://github.com/SolutionStrategist/Leadership/wiki) to develop a diverse workforce for everyone

The thoughts and ideas here are my own. Take what you need and leave the rest.  Tell me what is and isn't working for you via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/karuana) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/karuanagatimu).  I'm always happy to hear from you.

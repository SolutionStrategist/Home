I am a technology professional with more than 25 years experience as a business architect and technologist.  My passion is finding ways to leverage technology to solve business problems.  I've run large and small services, my own company and worked across multiple public and private industries.  Currently, I work in the Microsoft Teams Engineering Group running worldwide support, technical readiness and working with our FastTrack teams to help customers onboard to this new, transformative product.  

Formerly, I worked in Microsoft IT in a variety of roles centered on cloud services, was Director of Ecommerce & Marketing Operations & Lead SharePoint Architect for SKECHERS, USA and ran my own technology marketing firm.  I've always believed in the power of community and was the founder of the Community Leadership Board for development of people in the collaboration space.  Twice named to the SharePoint50, a worldwide list of top influencers in the SharePoint ecosystem, she was also on the Los Angeles Committee for Women in SharePoint, the co-founder of the Los Angeles SharePoint Saturday and the Los Angeles SharePoint User Group.  

I speak frequently about leadership, the future of collaboration, Office 365 and ensuring you are doing meaningful work in an ever changing industry.  You can also find me on YouTube on my show [Coffee in the Cloud](https://aka.ms/CoffeeintheCloudTV), co-produced by my awesome collegue Zulna Heriscar.   

I believe that **enthusiasm** is a management principle.
